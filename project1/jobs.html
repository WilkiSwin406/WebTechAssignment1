        <h4>Jacob Mackey, Data Analyst (employed 2 years)</h4>
        <p><em>"Before I started working at CyberBytes, my life was miserable. I had no money - how was I supposed to afford anything? Luckily, CyberBytes swooped in and granted me a position as a Data Analyst, and now I have money! Truly, this job is a dream come true."</em></p>
        <h4>Macob Jackey, UX Designer (employed 2 years)</h4>
        <p><em>"I used to be an art school student. Sadly, it turns out nobody really wants to hire artists anymore! Thankfully, while I was fresh out of a job, CyberBytes was there to help, and gave me a job as one of their UX designers, which pays 25 cents above minimum wage! Since then, I've never been strapped for cash again. Thanks CyberBytes!"</em></p>
        <h4>John Bytes, CEO</h4>
        <p><em>"CyberBytes was the brainchild of two broke college students - Me, John Bytes, and my dear old friend Cyber Greg. It was always our dream to create a company that would specialise in creating software. Sadly, Cyber Greg is no longer with us...but his dream lives on, in CyberBytes! Let's thrive together!</em></p>
        <h4>Sharon Spoon, Cloud Engineer (employed 6 years)</h4>
        <p><em>"CyberBytes has been a really good job for me. There's many opportunities for growth and you're paid quite well in the as a senior employee. On top of that, you're allowed a lot of freedom with your work, so the job doesn't really get boring. I haven't really worked with any company before that feels like they actually care about their employees, but CyberBytes feels like a family. In only fourteen more years I'll have worked here long enough to take my eight days of long-service leave!"</em></p>
